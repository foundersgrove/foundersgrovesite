						The project increased marketing capabilities and improved the
						overall user experience while allowing the Treehouse team to see
						more data with google analytics integration that wasn't possible
						before. This project utilized a headless wordpress backend and had
						to be rerouted to take over the preexisting shopify blog.

						The Homeschooling Style Quiz

					<p>
						The Homeschool Style Quiz was a project that was created to engage
						the audience of Treehouse Schoolhouse. The quiz was designed to be a
						fun and interactive way for parents to learn about different
						homeschooling styles and to help them decide which style would be
						best for their family. Our custom quiz solution was able to create a
						better user experience and directly lead parents to purchasing new
						products.
